Python Robotics Simulator
================================

This is a simple, portable robot simulator developed by [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org).
Some of the arenas and the exercises have been modified for the Research Track I course

Installing and running
----------------------

The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

Pygame, unfortunately, can be tricky (though [not impossible](http://askubuntu.com/q/312767)) to install in virtual environments. If you are using `pip`, you might try `pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame`, or you could use your operating system's package manager. Windows users could use [Portable Python](http://portablepython.com/). PyPyBox2D and PyYAML are more forgiving, and should install just fine using `pip` or `easy_install`.

## Troubleshooting

When running `python run.py <file>`, you may be presented with an error: `ImportError: No module named 'robot'`. This may be due to a conflict between sr.tools and sr.robot. To resolve, symlink simulator/sr/robot to the location of sr.tools.

On Ubuntu, this can be accomplished by:
* Find the location of srtools: `pip show sr.tools`
* Get the location. In my case this was `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`
* Create symlink: `ln -s path/to/simulator/sr/robot /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sr/`

To run one or more scripts in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file names. 

```bash
$ python2 run.py assignment.py
```

Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].

### Motors ###

The simulated robot has two motors configured for skid steering, connected to a two-output [Motor Board](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/motor_board). The left motor is connected to output `0` and the right motor to output `1`.

The Motor Board API is identical to [that of the SR API](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/motors/), except that motor boards cannot be addressed by serial number. So, to turn on the spot at one quarter of full power, one might write the following:

```python
R.motors[0].m0.power = 25
R.motors[0].m1.power = -25
```

### The Grabber ###

The robot is equipped with a grabber, capable of picking up a token which is in front of the robot and within 0.4 metres of the robot's centre. To pick up a token, call the `R.grab` method:

```python
success = R.grab()
```

The `R.grab` function returns `True` if a token was successfully picked up, or `False` otherwise. If the robot is already holding a token, it will throw an `AlreadyHoldingSomethingException`.

To drop the token, call the `R.release` method.

Cable-tie flails are not implemented.

### Vision ###

To help the robot find tokens and navigate, each token has markers stuck to it, as does each wall. The `R.see` method returns a list of all the markers the robot can see, as `Marker` objects. The robot can only see markers which it is facing towards.

Each `Marker` object has the following attributes:

* `info`: a `MarkerInfo` object describing the marker itself. Has the following attributes:
  * `code`: the numeric code of the marker.
  * `marker_type`: the type of object the marker is attached to (either `MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD`, `MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER` or `MARKER_ARENA`).
  * `offset`: offset of the numeric code of the marker from the lowest numbered marker of its type. For example, token number 3 has the code 43, but offset 3.
  * `size`: the size that the marker would be in the real game, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `centre`: the location of the marker in polar coordinates, as a `PolarCoord` object. Has the following attributes:
  * `length`: the distance from the centre of the robot to the object (in metres).
  * `rot_y`: rotation about the Y axis in degrees.
* `dist`: an alias for `centre.length`
* `res`: the value of the `res` parameter of `R.see`, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `rot_y`: an alias for `centre.rot_y`
* `timestamp`: the time at which the marker was seen (when `R.see` was called).

Explanation
------------
 This project's goal is to grab every token of a certain area a then put it all together in one point.
 The code should make the robot:
	* Go to the center of the arena
	* See the markers that are in the area
	* Pick the first marker that he saw in the point before and release it in the center
     	* Pick the other markers and release it beside the first one

```python
	v = [] #list of token 
	p = [] #list of grab token
	search = True
	primo = True
	drive(50,6)
	search_token(v,search)
	print(v)
	code1 = v[0] # define the first token that have to be pick
	if len(v) == 0: # If there are no token then the program finish 
		print("There are no token")
		search = not search
	while search == True:
		if primo == True: # If is the first token then run the program primo_token
			primo_token(code1,v,search)
			p.append(code1) # append the first value of the token that he grab
			primo = not primo # for now on there is not more a first token
		else:
			for code in v[1:]: # this start from the second token because the first is the  clause of the if
				take_token(code,code1,v,search)
				p.append(code)
		if len(p) == len(v): # when the list of token in the arena is equal to the one that have been grab then the task is finish
			search = not search
```
